Define accessibility in the context of web development.
Accessibility in web development refers to designing websites and web applications so that they are usable by people with disabilities. This includes individuals who may have visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

Why Accessibility is Essential:

It ensures inclusivity, allowing all users to access and interact with content.
Legal compliance (e.g., ADA, WCAG standards).
Improves user experience for all users, such as older adults or users in challenging environments (e.g., low lighting, noisy settings).
Benefits businesses by increasing reach and avoiding potential lawsuits.
Benefits for Different User Groups:

Visually impaired users: Screen readers rely on accessible content.
Hearing impaired users: Closed captions and transcripts for multimedia.
Users with motor disabilities: Keyboard navigation support.
Cognitive disabilities: Clear, simple content improves usability.
